You can report the security vulnerabilities you find within the scope of Bitexen Vulnerability Reporting Program by using any of these drafts. In this way, you can both facilitate the work of our team and earn additional rewards :) You can delete the fields that you do not use in the draft while preparing your report.

Compress your report and other necessary files for verification (Burp project, exploit code, screenshots, etc.) and send it to [e-mail address](mailto:bugbounty@bitexen.com) or use the form at [this address](https://bugbounty.bitexen.com/).
